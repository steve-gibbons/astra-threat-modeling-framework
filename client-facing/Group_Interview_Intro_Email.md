# ASTRA Sample Introductory Email for Interview Sessions

**Subject:** [ASTRA Security Architecture Review] Interview Session Invitation

---

Dear [Participant Names],

As part of the **ASTRA Security Architecture Review and Threat Modeling** effort, we are conducting structured interviews to better understand the system’s design, business context, and potential risk areas.

---

**Purpose:**  
These sessions are **collaborative and improvement-focused**. They are _not_ audits or compliance checks.

---

**Format:**  
- Group conversation with multiple SMEs and stakeholders
- Focused on architecture, business goals, and operational realities
- Open discussion encouraged — questions and clarifications are welcome

---

**Optional Preparation:**  
- Review any available system diagrams or related materials
- Bring real-world examples, operational insights, or known challenges

---

**Key Points:**  
- **Candid input is valued** — partial or incomplete information is better than none
- **“I don’t know” is a perfectly acceptable answer**
- Our shared goal is to **identify opportunities for improvement**, _not_ to assign blame

---

Thank you in advance for your time and insights.  
We look forward to the discussion.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Organization / Role]

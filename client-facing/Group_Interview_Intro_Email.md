# ASTRA Sample Introductory Email for Interview Sessions

Subject: [ASTRA Security Architecture Review] Interview Session Invitation

Dear [Participant Names],

As part of the ASTRA Security Architecture Review and Threat Modeling effort, we are conducting structured interviews to better understand system design, operations, and potential risk areas.

**Purpose:**  
These sessions are collaborative and improvement-driven. They are not audits or compliance checks.

**Format:**  
- Group conversation style (multiple SMEs present)
- Focused on system architecture, business context, and operational realities
- Immediate clarifications and explorations encouraged

**Preparation (Optional):**  
- Review any available system diagrams
- Bring real-world examples or operational insights

**Key Points:**  
- Candidness is valued \- partial information is better than silence
- \"I don't know\" is an acceptable answer
- Our goal is risk discovery, not blame

Thank you for your participation!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Organization / Consultant Title]

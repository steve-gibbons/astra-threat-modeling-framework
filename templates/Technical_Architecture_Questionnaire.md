# Technical Architecture Questionnaire (ASTRA v1.1)

**Purpose:**  
To capture the technical design, integration points, data handling, and resilience of the system.

---

## System Overview
- Please describe the primary components and technologies used.
- Is the system primarily on-premises, cloud-based, hybrid, or distributed?

## Data and Privacy
- What types of sensitive data are collected, processed, or stored? *(e.g., PII, PHI, PCI, IP, Proprietary Business Data)*
- How is sensitive data protected at rest and in transit?

## Access and Authentication
- What authentication methods are used (MFA, SSO, OAuth, etc.)?
- How is authorization enforced across the system?

## External Dependencies
- List critical external services and providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, SaaS platforms, third-party APIs).
- How are external service risks monitored or mitigated?

## Emerging Technologies
- Does the system incorporate AI/ML models, LLMs, autonomous agents, blockchain, or IoT components?
- If AI/ML is used, how are models validated, secured, and monitored for misuse or drift?

## Monitoring and Incident Response
- Is this system integrated with organizational monitoring (SIEM, EDR, logging infrastructure)?
- What incident detection, response, and recovery capabilities exist for this system?

## Architecture and Threat Surface
- Are up-to-date architecture diagrams available (including trust boundaries and data flows)?
- What are the major entry points and external interfaces?
- Have any significant recent changes been made to the system architecture?

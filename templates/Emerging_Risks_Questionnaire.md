# Emerging Risks Questionnaire (ASTRA v1.2)

**Purpose:**  
To surface **emerging risks**, **novel technologies**, and **newly introduced factors** that may not be fully addressed by existing governance, architecture, or security reviews.

## New or Evolving Technologies

- Is the system leveraging **emerging technologies** such as:
  - Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML)?
  - Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)?
  - Internet of Things (IoT) or Edge Computing?
  - Quantum computing readiness or cryptography changes?
  - Generative AI models or Large Language Models (LLMs)?

---

## Changing Usage Patterns or Threat Landscape

- Are there **new ways** the system is being used that were not originally designed for?
- Are there **increased user populations**, **higher data volumes**, or **expanded integrations**?
- Have there been **new threat intelligence reports** or **attack patterns** identified?

---

## Legal, Regulatory, or Policy Shifts

- Are there **new or upcoming regulations** that could impact the system?
- Have any **contractual obligations**, **privacy laws**, or **compliance frameworks** changed recently?

---

## Supply Chain and Vendor Changes

- Have any **new third-party vendors** or **dependencies** been introduced?
- Are there **geopolitical risks** or **supply chain shifts** impacting the system?

---

## Organizational or Strategic Shifts

---

## Unknowns, Gaps, or Unaddressed Areas

- Are there any **areas of uncertainty** or **known gaps** in the system’s risk coverage?
- Are there **emerging concerns** not fully captured by current risk management processes?

---

## Notes

Use this questionnaire to supplement traditional ASTRA assessments when **novel technologies**, **changing environments**, or **emerging risks** are suspected. Responses can be summarized into the Unified Working Spreadsheet or attached as a standalone artifact.

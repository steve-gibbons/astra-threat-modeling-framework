# ASTRA vs. Other Threat Modeling and Risk Methodologies

---

## Overview

This document compares ASTRA (Architecture and Security Threat Review and Analysis) to several other prominent threat modeling and risk assessment methodologies.

ASTRA was developed intentionally to address gaps in existing approaches: emphasizing business alignment, pragmatic flexibility, and actionable risk prioritization, while remaining collaborative and lightweight.

This comparison is provided to help practitioners understand how ASTRA complements or differs from other frameworks.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | ASTRA | STRIDE | PASTA | LINDDUN | OCTAVE | FAIR |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Collaborative security and risk discovery | Threat enumeration | Attack simulation modeling | Privacy threat modeling | Organizational risk assessment | Quantitative risk assessment |
| **Focus** | Business context, architecture risks, prioritization | Specific threat types | Attack paths and scenarios | Privacy violations | Risk to critical assets | Financial loss estimation |
| **Approach Style** | Structured but flexible | Checklist-driven | Heavy process (7 stages) | Checklist-driven | Formal workshops | Quantitative modeling |
| **Business Alignment** | Very High | Medium | Medium | Medium | High | High |
| **Usability for Smaller Teams** | Very High | Medium | Low | Medium | Low | Low |
| **Complexity Level** | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate | High | High |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium | Low | Medium | Low | Low |
| **Primary Outputs** | Risk Findings, Critical Action Items, Business-Aligned Recommendations | Threat categories identified | Attack paths, threat trees | Privacy threat scenarios | Risk profiles | Loss exceedance curves, financial risk metrics |
| **Risk Prioritization** | Built-in (severity, likelihood, RCID, cost, timeline, residual) | Minimal (only implicit) | Emerging during attack simulation | Minimal (privacy focused) | Subjective ranking | Full quantitative scoring |

## Key ASTRA Differentiators

**Collaboration-Centric:**  
ASTRA is built around structured interviews and expert discussions rather than rigid checklist completion or attack simulation.

**Business-First Alignment:**  
Risk identification and prioritization are explicitly tied to business context and RCID-mapped organizational impact, not just technical threat likelihood.

**Risk Prioritization Built-In:**  
ASTRA integrates severity, likelihood, repair cost, timeline, difficulty, and residual risk scoring into its standard findings process.

**Lightweight and Scalable:**  
ASTRA is accessible to small teams as well as large enterprises. It intentionally minimizes overhead while allowing optional expansions for more formal environments.

**Realistic, Actionable Results:**  
Deliverables are intended to directly inform architecture improvements and governance decisions. The goal is meaningful security and resilience improvements, not theoretical threat coverage.

**Comprehensive Impact Taxonomy:**
ASTRA’s RCID model covers safety, privacy, integrity, availability, financial, and strategic domains in one list.

## Conclusion

ASTRA complements existing methodologies by offering a practical, business-aligned, and collaboration-driven approach to architecture review and threat modeling.  The framework’s RCID taxonomy ensures findings map directly to the business, safety, privacy, and strategic consequences that matter, using ASTRA’s RCID (Risk Context & Impact Domain) model.

Organizations seeking:
- Pragmatic security insights,
- Prioritized risk mitigation strategies,
- Alignment to business objectives,
- Lightweight, flexible execution,

will find ASTRA an effective methodology, whether used alone or alongside formal models such as STRIDE, OCTAVE, or FAIR.

# ASTRA Threat Modeling and Security Architecture Review Framework

---

## Overview

**ASTRA** (Architecture and Security Threat Review and Analysis)  
is a collaborative, business-driven methodology for security architecture review and threat modeling.

ASTRA focuses on uncovering real-world risks through:
- Business context alignment
- System architecture discovery
- Structured interviews
- Prioritized risk analysis
- Actionable improvement recommendations

ASTRA is **not an audit** â€” it is an **inquisitive, improvement-focused exercise** aimed at enhancing resilience, security, and governance.

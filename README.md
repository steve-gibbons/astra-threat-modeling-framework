## About ASTRA

ASTRA (Architecture and Security Threat Review and Analysis) is a lightweight, collaborative, business-driven security architecture and risk review methodology developed from over 25 years of frontline experience at Wells Fargo, American Express, Ameriprise Financial, and IBM.

Designed to eliminate unnecessary complexity, ASTRA enables meaningful risk discovery through structured yet accessible processes. Most small to medium implementations can be interviewed within 2 to 4 hours, often yielding immediate preliminary insights, without requiring specialized training for participants.

ASTRA is not an audit. It is an inquisitive, improvement-focused exercise aimed at enhancing resilience, security, and governance through:

- Business context alignment  
- System architecture discovery  
- Structured interviews  
- Prioritized risk analysis  
- Actionable improvement recommendations

ASTRA emphasizes:

- **Business alignment** – Grounded in real-world mission and operational goals  
- **Simplicity of execution** – Uses clear templates and plain language  
- **Operational transparency** – Encourages open discussion and traceability  
- **Scalable structure** – Adaptable to both startups and enterprise environments  
- **Collaboration over confrontation** – Findings are meant to improve, not punish  
- **Action over theory** – Designed to yield tangible, practical outcomes

## Use Cases

ASTRA is suitable for:
- Internal system or service assessments
- Vendor or third-party risk evaluations
- Cloud architecture and migration planning
- Privacy and compliance readiness
- M&A and investment due diligence
- Emerging tech and AI risk reviews

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [ASTRA Practitioner’s Manual](./Astra%20Practitioner%20Manual%201.1.1.md)
2. Download and copy the templates from [./templates/](./templates/)
3. Use the questionnaires to gather business and technical context
4. Conduct structured interviews 
5. Document risks and other findings in the [Unified Working Spreadsheet](./templates/Unified_Working_Spreadsheet.xlsx)

No specialized tooling is required beyond a spreadsheet application. ASTRA is intentionally designed to meet teams where they are—technically and culturally.

## About This Project

ASTRA is dedicated to my fiancée, Karen, who inspires me to seek the light, to fight the Dark Side, and to believe that clarity, collaboration, and resilience are forces for good — in both life and work.

This framework is my contribution back to the security and risk management community that shaped me. It reflects decades of field experience, and the belief that we can build better systems not by adding more friction, but by focusing on what matters.

In a time of economic uncertainty and shifting priorities, ASTRA is also a personal statement:

I’m still here.  
I’m still building.  
I’m still fighting for what matters.

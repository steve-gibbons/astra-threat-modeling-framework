# Contributing to ASTRA

---

Thank you for considering contributing to the ASTRA Threat Modeling and Security Architecture Review Framework!

ASTRA is a collaborative, business-driven framework focused on helping organizations uncover real-world risks and strengthen security architectures.  
We welcome contributions that align with ASTRA's core philosophy: **collaboration, pragmatism, and improvement.**

## Ways You Can Contribute

- Propose improvements to templates or guides
- Suggest additions to questionnaires (business or technical)
- Submit corrections (spelling, clarity, formatting)
- Help create new examples (case studies, visual diagrams)
- Share new ideas for future expansions (advanced scoring, control mappings)

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Focus on clarity and usability.**  
  ASTRA is intended to be accessible to a wide range of practitioners, not only experts.

- **Preserve lightweight core templates.**  
  Deeper or specialized materials (e.g., expanded questionnaires) should be submitted as optional enhancements, not replacements.

- **Respect the collaborative, improvement-driven tone.**  
  ASTRA is not designed as a compliance audit framework. Contributions should reinforce its collaborative approach.

- **Submit clean, complete pull requests.**  
  PRs should clearly describe the change, include updated templates or documents as needed, and maintain consistent formatting with existing materials.

## Future Expansion Ideas (Beyond v1.3)

- Multiple case studies for different industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, SaaS).
- Optional deeper scoring model (Likelihood x Impact weightings).
- Common Controls Mapping Appendices (e.g., align findings to NIST CSF, ISO 27001).
- Expanded language translations (longer-term global expansion).
- Create an "Optional Expanded Questionnaire Pack" (v1.2 or later): Introduce a separate set of deeper business context and technical architecture questionnaires for highly regulated or complex systems, while keeping ASTRA’s core questionnaires lightweight and approachable.
